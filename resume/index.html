            <h4>Personal Project: Image Classification on Vehicles</h4>
            <p>
                June - July 2025<br>
                Developed and trained a convolutional neural network to classify images into 20 distinct vehicle types 
                using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving approximately 90% validation accuracy through iterative tuning and evaluation of model performance<br>
                Conducted extensive preprocessing and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity and reduce model overfitting<br>
                Deployed a user-facing web application using Streamlit that allows dynamic image input, runs real-time predictions, 
                and returns vehicle classification results along with confidence scores<br>

            <h4>Principles of Data Science: Analysis Great British Bake Off</h4>
            <p>
                January - March 2024<br>
                Leveraged Python (pandas, NumPy) to analyze 10+ seasons of competition data, identifying key trends 
                in recipe difficulty and contestant performance through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing<br>
                Designed and executed hypothesis tests to validate competition biases through statistical analysis of demographic 
                factors affecting contestant success, evaluation of recipe difficulty differentials between judges, and correlation 
                analysis between challenge performance and outcomes<br>
                Developed visualizations to communicate insights, enabling the identification of systemic patterns in reality TV 
                competition structures through the analysis of challenge difficulty<br>
            </p>

            <h4> Principles of Data Science: Taylor Swift Song Recommendation System</h4>
            <p>
                January - March 2024<br>
                Designed a Python-based song recommendation system using similarity on audio features (danceability, energy, valence), 
                processing datasets with pandas and NumPy to generate personalized Taylor Swift song suggestions<br>
                Solved text isolation challenges in lyric analysis by implementing tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, enabling efficient visualizations of keywords across Taylor Swift's 198 songs<br>
                Built an integrated system combining audio-feature recommendations and lyric-based search functionality, allowing users to discover songs through both musical attributes and lyrical content<br>
