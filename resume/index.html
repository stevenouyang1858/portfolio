                Leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy) to analyze 10+ seasons of competition data, identifying key trends 
                in recipe difficulty and contestant performance through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing<br>
                Designed and executed hypothesis tests to validate competition biases through statistical analysis of demographic 
                factors affecting contestant success, evaluation of recipe difficulty differentials between judges, and correlation 
                analysis between challenge performance and outcomes<br>
                Developed visualizations to communicate insights, enabling the identification of systemic patterns in reality TV 
                competition structures through the analysis of challenge difficulty<br>

                <time datetime="2024-01-04">January</time> - <time datetime="2024-03-15">March</time> 2024<br>
                Designed a Python-based song recommendation system using similarity on audio features (danceability, energy, valence), 
                processing datasets with pandas and NumPy to generate personalized Taylor Swift song suggestions<br>
                Solved text isolation challenges in lyric analysis by implementing tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, enabling efficient 
                visualizations of keywords across Taylor Swift's 198 songs<br>
                Built an integrated system combining audio-feature recommendations and lyric-based search functionality, 
                allowing users to discover songs through both musical attributes and lyrical content<br>
